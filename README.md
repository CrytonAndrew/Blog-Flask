# Flask Blog - RESTful API build

This is a blog build using the flask framework. We use flask in order to create a restful API for making any queries to the database and serving up data

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following required packages. However a requirements.txt file included

```bash
pip install flask_bootstrap
pip install flask_sqlalchemy
pip install 
```

## Usage

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, request
from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, URL
from flask_ckeditor import CKEditor, CKEditorField

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = '8BYkEfBA6O6donzWlSihBXox7C0sKR6b'
ckeditor = CKEditor(app)
Bootstrap(app)

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///posts.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

```
